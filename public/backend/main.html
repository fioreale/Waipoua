<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="web-architecture">Web Architecture</h3>

<div>
    <img src="UML.svg" width="100%" alt="...">
</div>
<p> The HTML pages are not rendered on the server side since, like it's possible to see from the diagram, Javascript
    code
    handles the fetching of the resources.
    Such data are picked up from the server side, through the REST API, and then they dynamically fill the HTML pages
    with
    respect to the specific page that does the request.
    Moreover, each page manages its own dynamic content with its own javascript code.</p>
<h3 id="api">API</h3>
<h4 id="rest-compliance">REST compliance</h4>
<p>Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are the reasons for which you might have decided
    to diverge. Note, you must not describe the whole API here, just the design decisions. <strong>TODO: chiara</strong>
</p>
<h4 id="openapi-resource-models">OpenAPI Resource models</h4>
<p>Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for resources. <strong>TODO: chiara</strong></p>
<h3 id="data-model">Data model</h3>
<p>Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web application. How these map to the OpenAPI
    data model? <strong>TODO: chiara</strong></p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="tools-used">Tools used</h3>
<p>First, an OpenAPI has been developed on swagger.io and a node-js server has been generated. Secondly, the JavaScript
    language has been used to implement the data layer and the server. The front-end part has been written in HTML and
    CSS with a common-used framework, i.e. Bootstrap.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Waipoua website adheres to the provided OpenAPI specifications since, doing a series of requests against the
        API concerning all the aspect of the interface, we proved its functionalities: by trying all the parameters
        (singularly and in combination).
        Once we checked that all the paths together with the parameters work correctly (essentially if they returned
        each time the correct json object(s)), we began to use them within the web application.</p></li>
    <li><p>Our application adheres to REST common practices because there is both a set of static-assets (i.e. web pages
        that do not require the access to the database) and a set of pages that require data from the database. In this
        case, they are retrieved through the data layer and (if necessary) cached, to reduce the number of calles made
        to the database.</p></li>
    <li><p>Since the website does not provide any login form, there is no need to manage the session of the user. The
        website only retrieves information from the database and displays them in the pages.</p></li>
    <li><p>We used a relational database written in SQL and PostGres as DBMS.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-information">Other information</h2>
<h3 id="task-assignment">Task assignment</h3>
<p>To be more efficient, we decided to split the work in the following way:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Alessio worked on the front-end (50%), Data Layer development (40% of the time) and DataBase (10% of the
        time)</p></li>
    <li><p>Chiara worked on the front-end (40%), OpenAPI specification (30% of time) and DataBase (30% of the time)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, Alessio checked the code of Chiara and viceversa, to ensure a complete understanding of the code and a
    higher improvement of the acquired competences.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-of-existing-api">Analysis of existing API</h3>
<p>We did not search for existing APIs.</p>
<h3 id="learning-outcome">Learning outcome</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Chiara wanted to learn more about the front-end development in HTML and CSS and acquired competences in
        Bootstrap usage. Moreover, she learned a lot about REST APIs and how they are implemented, as she was very
        curious of this topic of which she often heard about.</p></li>
    <li><p>Alessio approached the web development for the first time so it's been an opportunity to learn many
        programming languages like Javascript and the markup ones (HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap library as well). Also
        for him it's been really challenging and very interesting at the same time the back-end development, discovering
        a new way to intend the management
        of data: how it's possible to exchange information between client and server. Alessio studied REST API
        specifications which it's been essential to understand the behavior the website would have had. </p></li>
