Via Bellagio 52, Milano	At Waipoua we strongly believe in how human work can impact the environment  in both senses: human kind has changed throughout the century the appearance of our Mother Earth and its activites  are damaging our planet. On the other hand we believe to have the power to change the things: if we all work together, we can set a positive change of direction that will allow people to protect nature  save our precious forest and reduce the pollution. We need you for our mission! If you are interested in what we do. Please contact us!	02 4589	association@waipoua.org	Waipoua

0	What is Waipoua? What is our mission? Who we are? This is what you’ll learn if you join our “meet us” event! You’ll be surprised of how much we have to offer. Fighting to protect the environment, our mission relies on three areas: protecting the animals, saving the forests and fighting the pollution. Come to see what we do in each areas and join us!	1	\N	Come to meet us!	5	Via Beltrami 1, Milano	28	9	2020	15	0
3	In our oasis, we heal injured animals that we find in nature and provide safe places where animals at risk of exintion can live. If you are a teacher and you want to show to your children how the association works, come to visit our oasis by booking a guided tour!	1	1	Visit the oasis with schools!	1	Via Beltrami 1, Milano	12	12	2020	16	0
2	What is the plastic island inside the pacific ocean and why is it there? How does garbage pollute our seas? That’s what we’ll explain here. We’ll sell hand-made products with recycled plastic and the gain will be used to substain our activities of cleansing of the seas! Join us and make an offer, so that we can raise funds! A buffet is offered too.	11	8	CleanSea fund raising	4	Via Beltrami 1, Milano	11	11	2020	15	0
1	What can we do with plastic? That’s what we will try to learn in this event: do you know that it is possible to build a whole house made by plastic? If you are curios, come to this event!	7	8	Plastic house	3	Via Beltrami 1, Milano	10	10	2020	17	0

0	Protection oasis	Sometimes animals are found injured by our volunteers: if this happens, they are brought in our oasis, where they can heal before being put again into nature. In our oasis, we organize also guided tours, to let people and scolarships know how animals can be protected and treated with the respect they deserve.	1
1	Fight against hunt and poaching	Several animals are hunted for their qualities: the most famous one is the ivory. Poaching is the illegal hunt of animals, for example done outside the allowed time periods or by hunting protected species. We strongly believe that this is wrong and we collaborate with Forest Guards to fight this crime.	1
4	Control of breedings 	Our vets and biologists work with breedings centres to be sure that the animals are treated accoding to the current normatives. We collaborate, when possible, with forest guard and police when controls are needed in breeding centres.	1
5	Fight against deforestation	Deforastation is a major problem in activities against nature conservation: the conservation of trees is fundamental for our survival since they produce the oxygen that we breath. To do our part, we try to sensibilize people to the current situation of the forests and teach them what they can do to make their part.	2
6	Protection against fires	Fires inside forests can cause huge damages to the entire ecosystem, affecting also the ecosystem that lives within. We collaborate with forest guards and firefighters and sensibilize the population against the correct behaviours to take in order to avoid fires.	2
7	Rounds in the forests	Rounds are very important to monitor both fires and hunting. We help forest guards by providing volunteers who make turns to do rounds in the forests.	2
8	Recycle activities	Recycling is important to controle the quantity of garbage throown in the nature: whenever this is possible, it should be a moral imperative do recycle it. We try to do our best to create objects for the houses, clothes and other things with recycled material. Our poducts are then sold and the gain is used to finance our oasis or is devoluted in beneficence.	3
9	Air quality control	Air quality is important for the health of us all. Air pollution can cause lumg diseases and the continuous emission of carbon dioxide causes an increase of the greenhouse effect, with all the well-known consequences. The scientists that work in our associations help in this sense by providing air qualitites controls.	3
12	How to do separate collection	Separate collection is now compulsory in Italy, but often it is difficult to do it. We organize events with laboratories that can teach adults and children how to do a sensible separate collection.	3
10	Removal of garbage in the forests	Garbage in the forests damages the ecosystem and can injure the animals that live within. Our volunteers help in collecting the garbages and senzibilize the population about the correct behaviour to take with respect to garbage.	3
2	Protection of animals from exploitation	Not all animals that are breed live in healthy conditions: because of this, we decided to to our best to promote and suggest products that are cruelty-free, i.e. that are created without exploiting the animals. 	1
11	Removal of sea waste	Sea waste is a very big problem: an entire waste island is located in the pacific ocean because of the oceaning currents and the constant human pollution. We organize activities to remove waste from our sea (in particular, Mediterranean sea).	3
3	Protection of species at risk of extinction	A lot of species are at risk of extinction, others are already exincted. We take care of aimals by hosting them in our oasis, especially if they are injured. Sometimes they can be put into their natural environment, but sometimes this is not possible. Our purpose is to save them from extinction and provide them with a secure habitat where to live.	1
