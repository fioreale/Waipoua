Via Bellagio 52, Milano	At Waipoua we strongly believe in how human work can impact the environment  in both senses: human kind has changed throughout the century the appearance of our Mother Earth and its activites  are damaging our planet. On the other hand we believe to have the power to change the things: if we all work together, we can set a positive change of direction that will allow people to protect nature  save our precious forest and reduce the pollution. We need you for our mission! If you are interested in what we do. Please contact us!	02 4589	association@waipoua.org	Waipoua
