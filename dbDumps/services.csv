0	Protection oasis	Sometimes animals are found injured by our volunteers: if this happens, they are brought in our oasis, where they can heal before being put again into nature. In our oasis, we organize also guided tours, to let people and scolarships know how animals can be protected and treated with the respect they deserve.	1
1	Fight against hunt and poaching	Several animals are hunted for their qualities: the most famous one is the ivory. Poaching is the illegal hunt of animals, for example done outside the allowed time periods or by hunting protected species. We strongly believe that this is wrong and we collaborate with Forest Guards to fight this crime.	1
2	Protection of animals from exploitation;	Not all animals that are breed live in healthy conditions: because of this, we decided to to our best to promote and suggest products that are cruelty-free, i.e. that are created without exploiting the animals. 	1
3	Protection of species at risk of extinction;	A lot of species are at risk of extinction, others are already exincted. We take care of aimals by hosting them in our oasis, especially if they are injured. Sometimes they can be put into their natural environment, but sometimes this is not possible. Our purpose is to save them from extinction and provide them with a secure habitat where to live.	1
4	Control of breedings 	Our vets and biologists work with breedings centres to be sure that the animals are treated accoding to the current normatives. We collaborate, when possible, with forest guard and police when controls are needed in breeding centres.	1
5	Fight against deforestation	Deforastation is a major problem in activities against nature conservation: the conservation of trees is fundamental for our survival since they produce the oxygen that we breath. To do our part, we try to sensibilize people to the current situation of the forests and teach them what they can do to make their part.	2
6	Protection against fires	Fires inside forests can cause huge damages to the entire ecosystem, affecting also the ecosystem that lives within. We collaborate with forest guards and firefighters and sensibilize the population against the correct behaviours to take in order to avoid fires.	2
7	Rounds in the forests	Rounds are very important to monitor both fires and hunting. We help forest guards by providing volunteers who make turns to do rounds in the forests.	2
8	Recycle activities	Recycling is important to controle the quantity of garbage throown in the nature: whenever this is possible, it should be a moral imperative do recycle it. We try to do our best to create objects for the houses, clothes and other things with recycled material. Our poducts are then sold and the gain is used to finance our oasis or is devoluted in beneficence.	3
9	Air quality control	Air quality is important for the health of us all. Air pollution can cause lumg diseases and the continuous emission of carbon dioxide causes an increase of the greenhouse effect, with all the well-known consequences. The scientists that work in our associations help in this sense by providing air qualitites controls.	3
10	Removal of garbage in the forests	Garbage in the forests damages the ecosystem and can injure the animals that live within. Our volunteers help in collecting the garbages and senzibilize the population about the correct behaviour to take with respect to garbage.	3
11	Removal of sea waste;	Sea waste is a very big problem: an entire waste island is located in the pacific ocean because of the oceaning currents and the constant human pollution. We organize activities to remove waste from our sea (in particular, Mediterranean sea).	3
12	How to do separate collection	Separate collection is now compulsory in Italy, but often it is difficult to do it. We organize events with laboratories that can teach adults and children how to do a sensible separate collection.	3
